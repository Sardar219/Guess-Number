# Guess Number Game

The "Guess the Number" game in JavaScript involves generating a random number within a defined range, typically from 1 to 20. The player then attempts to guess the number, with each guess triggering feedback, such as "Too High" or "Too Low," until the correct number is found. JavaScript functions handle the game logic, random number generation, and feedback display, making this game an excellent beginner project to practice loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
